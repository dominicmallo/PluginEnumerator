------------------------------------------------- 

A Man-in-the-Browser (MitB) Attack is a type of Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack specifically involving a browser infected with some type of proxy malware.

All browser plugins require some level of access to the browser.

Most users don't realize what access they are giving when they install plugins.

Each month, Google removes hundreds of malicious plugins from their web store for abusing their permission levels, but some trojans may be overlooked.

Your plugins may have access to  copy saved passwords, read your clipboard, see your cookies, make web request on your behalf, or even proxy all web requests!

These permissions are extremely dangerous and given that browser plugins do not require administrative access to install, you may be a victim of a MitB attack!

Find out by running my Chrome browser Plugin Enumerator for Windows!
